#ETL Pipeline Exercise – Code Review with GitHub Copilot

This repository contains a small ETL pipeline (CSV → cleaned Parquet → SQL aggregation + Airflow DAG) written by a “junior data engineer.”

##The goal of this exercise is to use GitHub Copilot to perform a realistic code review and identify ways to improve the code in terms of:

Correctness & reliability

Performance & scalability

Data quality & validation

Code structure & readability

Security & configuration management

Orchestration practices (Airflow)

SQL logic & best practices

##Test quality

You are NOT just looking for syntax errors.
Treat this as production code that needs review before merging.

##✅ How to perform the Code Review using GitHub Copilot

###1️⃣ Open this folder in VS Code

Make sure GitHub Copilot is enabled.

###2️⃣ Trigger Copilot Code Review

Use the Command Palette:

Windows / Linux:

Ctrl + Shift + P


macOS:

Cmd + Shift + P
